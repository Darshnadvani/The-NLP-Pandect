### MLOps for NLP
MLOps, especially when applied to NLP, is a set of best practices around automating various parts of the workflow when building and deploying NLP pipelines.

In general, MLOps for NLP includes having the following processes in place:
- **Data Versioning** - make sure your training, annotation and other types of data are versioned and tracked
- **Experiment Tracking** - make sure that all of your experiments are automatically tracked and saved where they can be easily replicated or retraced
- **Model Registry** - make sure any neural models you train are versioned and tracked and it is easy to roll back to any of them
- **Automated Testing and Behavioral Testing** - besides regular unit and integration tests, you want to have behavioral tests that check for bias or potential advesarial attacks
- **Model Deployment and Serving** - automate model deployment, ideally also with zero-downtime deploys like Blue/Green, Canary deploys etc.
- **Data and Model Observability** - track data drift, model accuracy drift etc.

Additionally, there are two more components that are not as prevalent for NLP and are mostly used for Computer Vision and other sub-fields of AI:
- **Feature Store** - centrarilized storage of all features developed for ML models than can be easily reused by any other ML project
- **Metadata Management** - storage for all information related to the usage of ML models, mainly for reproducing behavior of deployed ML models, artifact tracking etc.
